	<p>1.<font face="consolas"><strong>	Small and fragmented land-holdings</strong></font>:
The seemingly abundance of net sown area of 141.2 million hectares and total cropped area of 189.7 million hectares (1999-2000) pales into insignificance when we see that it is divided into economically unviable small and scattered holdings.
The average size of holdings was 2.28 hectares in 1970-71 which was reduced to 1.82 hectares in 1980-81 and 1.50 hectares in 1995-96. The size of the holdings will further decrease with the infinite Sub-division of the land holdings.</p>
<br>
<p>
2.<font face="consolas"><strong>	 Manures, Fertilizers and Biocides</strong></font>:
Indian soils have been used for growing crops over thousands of years without caring much for replenishing. This has led to depletion and exhaustion of soils resulting in their low productivity. The average yields of almost all the crops are among t e lowest in the world. This is a serious problem which can be solved by using more manures and fertilizers.</p>
<br>
<p>
3.<font face="consolas"><strong> Agricultural Marketing</strong></font>:
Agricultural marketing still continues to be in a bad shape in rural India. In the absence of sound marketing facilities, the farmers have to depend upon local traders and middlemen for the disposal of their farm produce which is sold at throw-away price</p>
<br>
<P>
4.<font face="consolas"><strong>	Misuse of lands</strong></font>:
People living in hilly areas tend to leave their places and migrate to plains due to lack of facilities. Such lands are good for growing tea, coffee etc but unfortunately these lands are left as it is thereby decreasing the fertility of the soil. On the other hand many cultivable lands are being used as residential lands to gain more profit. This overall decreases number of lands to be cultivated.</P>
<br>
<p>
5.<font face="consolas"><strong>	Government policies</strong></font>: 
Our government has started many polices for the benefit of farmers but unfortunately the execution of these policies had loopholes in it and in some way or the other the farmer only became a victim to his own profits.
