    <p><font style="color:greenyellow">The basic need of human being is food. It is the agriculture only which fulfils this need for the entire population of the world. Plants are called producers as they synthesize their own food using CO2 from air and water from soil utilizing sunlight as source of energy by a process known as photosynthesis. Chemistry deals with compounds, both organic and inorganic, and agriculture deals with the production of organic products using both organic and inorganic inputs Thus Chemistry forms an integral part of agriculture from molecular to organ level. It plays a role from the basics of photosynthesis to the utilization of agricultural produce. The advancements in this practice is only because of active research carried out in chemistry and then its applications to cause the land to produce more abundantly and at the same time to protect it from deterioration and misuse.</font></p>

<p><font style="color:greenyellow">Types of chemicals used</font> </p>
<ol>

    <li><font style="color:greenyellow"></font>Pesticides: <p><font style="color:greenyellow">Pesticides - Pesticides are substances that are meant to control pests, including weeds. The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticides (which may include insect growth regulators, termiticides, etc.).</font></p></li>
    <li><font style="color:greenyellow"></font>Insecticides: <p><font style="color:greenyellow">An insecticide is a pesticide used against insects. They include ovicides and larvicides used against the eggs and larvae of insects respectively. Insecticides are used in agriculture, medicine, industry, and general home use.</font></p></li>
    <li><font style="color:greenyellow"></font>Fungicides: <p><font style="color:greenyellow">- Fungicides are biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms used to kill parasitic fungi or their spores. A fungistatic inhibits their growth. Fungi can cause serious damage in agriculture, resulting in critical losses of yield, quality, and profit.- Fungicides are biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms used to kill parasitic fungi or their spores.

    <li><font style="color:greenyellow"></font>Herbicides: <p><font style="color:greenyellow">- Herbicides are chemicals used to destroy unwanted plants (terrestrial or aquatic) called weeds. Herbicides fall into two broad categories: inorganic (e.g., copper sulfate, sodium chlorate, and sodium arsenite) and organic (e.g., chlorophenoxy compounds.</font></p></li>

    <b><font size="20">Advantages and Disadvantages</b></font> <br>
    Advantages of applying fertilisers to the land are as follows-<br><br>
    I)  It increase crop yield and improves poor quality land<br>
    II) Manure improves soil texture,recycles nitrogen<br>
    III) Pasture is improved so animals fatten up quicker.<br>
    IV) Crops grow faster particularly when hybrid seeds are used.<br>
    
    <br>
    Disadvantages  of applying  fertilisers to the land are as follows-<br><br>
    I)   Crop grow better but so do weed.Therefore herbicides  are required too.<br>
    II)  Better quality plant attract insects so pesticides  may be needed.<br>
    III)  Excess nitrogen from fertillisers gets into water supplies causing fish to die.<br>
    IV)  Artificial fertilisers applied without  organic addition  do not improve soil structure.<br>
