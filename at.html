	<p> WHY CROP YEILD IS IMPORTANT?</p>
	<br>
<p> The concept of high-performance agriculture is key in understanding the importance of crop yields. How much you can produce within a given amount of land is essentially how efficient you are as a farmer. In today’s economy, being able to do things efficiently is as important as ever. You want to ensure that you are maximizing your space and the land you have worked to cultivate. Crop yields not only determine your efficiency, but your bottom-line as well.</p>

<p> <strong>Tips to increase crop production</strong> </p>
<p>
1. <font face="consolas"><strong> Soil Health Enhancement </strong></font>:
Agricultural universities, research institutions, krishi vigyan kendras, fertiliser companies, state departments of agriculture and farmers’ associations should aim to increase the productive potential of soil through concurrent attention to their physics, chemistry (macro and micro- nutrients) and micro-biology. Dry farming areas need particular attention.</p>
<br>

<p> 
2. <font face="consolas"><strong> Practice Seasonal Soil Rotation </strong></font>:
When you are planting season-by-season, it is important to understand how planting recurring crops can affect your overall yield. Planting corn in consecutive years has been proven to be less effective for optimal yields. This means that corn-on-corn planting should only be considered when your soil conditions are strong enough, or your land mass is limited. If you don’t have access to either, you may need to consider planting alternative crops in alternating years — such as soybeans.</p>
<br>
<p>
3. <font face="consolas"><strong> Ensure Proper Water Drainage </strong></font>:
Water management is essential to crop survival and maximizing your corn’s yield potential. It’s important to ensure your crop is getting enough water, but also that they aren’t being over-watered. Developing a drainage system in your crops can help prevent waterlogging and salinization in your soil, both of which can stifle growth and production.</p>
<br>
<p>
4. <font face="consolas"><strong> Acquiring new methods of farming </strong></font>: 
Farmers should be aware of new methods of growing crops. For example vertical farming should be implemented to save both land and water.</p>
<br>
<p>
5. <font face="consolas"><strong> Use of proper fertilizers </strong></font>:
Just as humans need essential minerals and nutrients for strong, healthy growth, so do the crops.
 Fertilizers replace the nutrients that crops remove from the soil. Without the addition of fertilizers, crop yields and agricultural productivity would be significantly reduced. That’s why mineral fertilizers are used to supplement the soil’s nutrient stocks with minerals that can be quickly absorbed and used by crops.
